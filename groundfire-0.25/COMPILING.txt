Compiling Groundfire
--------------------
The makefiles for groundfire are still quite primitive so they may require user
intervention to get them working properly. Remember, if you are using Windows,
there are pre-compiled binaries available on the website, so you do not need to
build Groundfire from the source unless you really want to play with the code.

I will be improving the makefiles for later versions of Groundfire.

* * *

Windows:
To compile on Windows you must have the following built and installed:

* MinGW v2 C/C++ compiler (available from www.mingw.org)
* OpenAL SDK              (available from www.openal.org)
* GLFW                    (available from glfw.sourceforge.net)

For the easiest installation, place the header and library files for GLFW and 
OpenAL in with the rest of the minGW header and library files.

Once all this is installed, building Groundfire should be as easy as typing 
'make' in the same directory as this file.

If you want to build groundfire with MSVC++, you must create a new project for 
it, include all the source files and link it with the OpenAL and GLFW libs.
Sorry, I don't have MSVC++ available so I cannot test that this works (but it
should).

* * * 

Linux:
To compile on Linux you must have the following installed:

* Build essentials (make, g++)
* OpenAL Soft (libopenal-dev)
* ALUT / freealut (libalut-dev)
* GLFW 3 (libglfw3-dev)
* OpenGL / GLU (usually provided by mesa-common-dev and libglu1-mesa-dev)

Type 'make' or 'make unix' to compile Groundfire.
Executable 'groundfire' will be created in the top-level directory.

Good luck ;-)
