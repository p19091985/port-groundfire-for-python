V0.25 - Third Release

* (Windows binary release only): Included the DLL that should make sound work 
  for those of you who don't have the openAL runtime installed.

* Terrain
  Made the terrain look more like Death tank. With a nice gradiant colour
  near the surface. There are still the occasional glitch with this but it's
  good enough for the time being.
  
* Bugfixes
  Fixed a bug that caused the machine gun sound to play continuously when
  you change weapons + a few other minor tweaks.
  
That's all for now. Not a lot in this release because I've been
concentrating on adding network play recently. Hopefully the next release will
feature an experimental network mode for you to try out.

V0.2 - Second Release (New features & bugfixes)

* Computer controlled tanks added 
  You can now set some tanks to be controlled by the computer. The AI is
  currently rather primitive (it won't make use of weapons and it makes no 
  attempt at avoiding being hit.)
  
* Redesigned player select screen
  The player select screen has been completely changed. This is mainly to allow
  Computer controlled tanks to be added to the game. It is now far more
  intuitive and powerful.
  
* More frame-rate independent
  Not a very noticeable change this, especially if the game runs at a good
  frame rate anyway on your computer. However, this is the first step towards 
  a networkable version of Groundfire.
  
* Mirv
  This new weapon has been added. Mirvs can be purchased at the shop. Mirvs
  act like normal shells but when they reach the apex of their trajectory, the
  mirv will split up into 5 mini shells which will rain down around the area
  targeted.
  
* Bugfixes
  - Mouse cursor will now not go off the screen in fullscreen mode, so you
    don't have to worry about losing it anymore.
  - The options screen controls will default to the current resolution and 
    screen mode, instead of always to 640x480 fullscreen.
  - Small tweaks to the game physics (probably unnoticeable)
